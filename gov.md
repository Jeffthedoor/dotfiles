* 99% of bills die here; they're *pigeonholed*. Subcomittee *and* Comitee have to vote yes for it to continue. when a bill is dead, it is dead for the term.
4. **House Rules Committee:**

	2. Closed Rule: Cannot be amended, can attach a time limit for debate. Effectively kills the bill.
	3. Limited Rule: Can be amended a specified # of times, with a specified time limit. Also kills the bill.
5. Goes to floor for debate

## federal bureaucracy
* dang i lost some notes i think

	president   --------- cabinet; highest ranking EOPs  | INDEP EXEC AGENCIES   | gov corp
   /     |    \           /    |   \                      | (not rlly under prez) |
EOP     EOP   EOP      DOJ     DOA   DOD <- departments   |  FEC, FCC, FTC, SEC   |
					   FBI     FDA   CIA <-  agencies     | enforce and regulate  |
								
* INDEP EXEC AGENCIES/REGULATORY BODIES
	* quasi-legislative abilities
		* can create rules that carry the weight of law
	* executive
		* this is inherent; can enforce laws
	* quasi-judicial responsibility
		* punish rule violators
	* beholden to congress and partially president
		* congress pulls on purse strings, and can also impeach
		* president can technically pull rank but really shouldn't
		* president can appoint, but there are terms unrelated to him, and he's usuall required to be impartial; usually run by a bipartisan board of directors
		* EXTREMELY powerful organizations
	* federal reserve
		* closed loop banking system; isn't funded by congress, really its own entity
		* isn't really beholden to anyone, but technically kind of under the executive bc pres appoints him
	* examples
		* CFPB
			* regulates banks
		* FCC
		* FTC
		* SEC
* non-independent regulatory:
	* FDA
* Government corporations
	* government agencies run like corporations; provide a good or service and charge for it

* states have their own bureaucracy
* all beurocracies adhere to these principles
	* Hierarchy
	* Rules (red tape)
	* Specialization

		* initial
			* Patronage/spoils system; garfield promised a role to some guy, he didn't get it, he shot big G

		* Hatch act - prevents public officials to promote other candidates
			* Pres and VP are exempt from this rule

			* Civil Servants can't be fired simply because of political beliefs; CAN be asked to resign
			* can also be fired for normal reasons (malfeasance, nonfeasance, misfeasance)
		* Holding bureaucrats accountable
			* people are mad at dems rn; their principle has been wait for people to hate republicans so they vote for dems
			* now they're complacent; they're just complaining, not really doing anything
			* everyone's yelling at them to do smth about it
			* Sunshine laws
				* FOIA; make things more apparent to the people
				* only exception is national security (or FERPA ig lol)
			* accountability to congress
				* congress legislates and funds bureaucracies
					* legislative: can rewrite the governing legislature for a bureau
					* funding: congress controls the pursestrings; can slash your funding if you do your job wrong
				* confress congress also monitors bureaucracies in the executive via oversight; monitors policy implementation
				* congress also monitors thru sunset clause; sets an expiration date for a program unless congress reauthorizes it
			* accountability to president
				* president also signs off on budgets; can pull on pursestrings as well
					* this allows him to ensure accountability as well
				* most top appointees serve at his pleasure, so most fall behind him
					* most, not  all
			* internal accountability
				* general rules (dress code, etc.)
				* whistleblower protections
				* Inspector General
					* someone inside of a bureaucratic agency that works with/inside an agency to monitor their activity
